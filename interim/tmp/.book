  "page-339": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">finally, \"ex lege naturae jure meritoque.\"  I submitted all\nthis to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin, of Nantucket,\nboth messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and they united in\nthe opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether insufficient.\nCharley profanely hinted they were humbug.</p><p>Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned\nground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me.\nThis fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal\nrespect does the whale differ from other fish.  Above, Linnaeus has given\nyou those items.  But in brief they are these:  lungs and warm blood;\nwhereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Next:  how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals,\nso as conspicuously to label him for all time to come.\nTo be short, then, a whale is a spouting fish with a horizontal tail.\nThere you have him.

Almost any one must have noticed\nthat all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat,\nbut a vertical, or up-and-down tail.
