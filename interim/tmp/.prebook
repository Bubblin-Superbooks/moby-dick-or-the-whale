Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him,\nhaving no serious misgivings now, and bent upon narrowly observing\nso curious a creature.  When, at last, his mind seemed made\nup touching the character of his bedfellow, and he became,\nas it were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon the floor,\nand by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that,\nif it pleased me, he would dress first and then leave me\nto dress afterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself.\nThinks I, Queequeg, under the circumstances, this is a very\ncivilized overture; but, the truth is, these savages have an\ninnate sense of delicacy, say what you will; it is marvellous\nhow essentially polite they are.  I pay this particular\ncompliment to Queequeg, because he treated me with so much\ncivility and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness;\nstaring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions;\nfor the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding.\nNevertheless, a man like Queequeg you don't see every day,\nhe and his ways were well worth unusual regarding."

However, hat and coat and\novershoes were one by one removed, and hung up in a little\nspace in an adjacent corner; when, arrayed in a decent suit,\nhe quietly approached the pulpit."

Halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder,\nand with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man-ropes,\nFather Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a truly sailor-like\nbut still reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted the steps\nas if ascending the main-top of his vessel."

In their gamesome but still serious way,\none whispers to the other—\"Jack, he's robbed a widow;\"\nor, \"Joe, do you mark him; he's a bigamist;\" or, \"Harry lad,\nI guess he's the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah,\nor belike, one of the missing murderers from Sodom.\"  Another runs\nto read the bill that's stuck against the spile upon the wharf\nto which the ship is moored, offering five hundred gold coins\nfor the apprehension of a parricide, and containing a description\nof his person.  He reads, and looks from Jonah to the bill;\nwhile all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah,\nprepared to lay their hands upon him.  Frighted Jonah trembles.\nand summoning all his boldness to his face, only looks so much\nthe more a coward.  He will not confess himself suspected;\nbut that itself is strong suspicion.

He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie;\nhe hides among the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters\nclimb the Alps.

All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were garnished\nlike one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale,\ninserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to.\nThose thews ran not through base blocks of land wood, but deftly travelled\nover sheaves of sea-ivory.

Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack\nof common consistency about worthy Captain Bildad.  Though refusing,\nfrom conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders,\nyet himself had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific;\nand though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his\nstraight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore.\nHow now in the contemplative evening of his days, the pious Bildad\nreconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do not know;\nbut it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably he had\nlong since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man's\nreligion is one thing, and this practical world quite another.\nThis world pays dividends.  Rising from a little cabin boy\nin short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad\nshad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief mate,\nand captain, and finally a shipowner; Bildad, as I hinted before,\nhad concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active\nlife at the goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining days\nto the quiet receiving of his well-earned income."

They told me in Nantucket, though it\ncertainly seems a curious story, that when he sailed the old\nCategut whaleman, his crew, upon arriving home, were mostly all\ncarried ashore to the hospital, sore exhausted and worn out.\nFor a pious man, especially for a Quaker, he was certainly\nrather hard-hearted, to say the least.  He never used to swear,\nthough, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an inordinate\nquantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them.\nWhen Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-colored eye\nintently looking at you, made you feel completely nervous,\ntill you could clutch something—a hammer or a marling-spike,\nand go to work like mad, at something or other, never mind what.\nIndolence and idleness perished from before him.  His own\nperson was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character.\nOn his long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh,\nno superfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to it,\nlike the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat."

He was a long, earnest man,\nand though born on an icy coast, seemed well adapted to endure\nhot latitudes, his flesh being hard as twice-baked biscuit.\nTransported to the Indies, his live blood would not spoil like\nbottled ale.  He must have been born in some time of general\ndrought and famine, or upon one of those fast days for which his\nstate is famous.  Only some thirty arid summers had he seen;\nthose summers had dried up all his physical superfluousness.\nBut this, his thinness, so to speak, seemed no more the token\nof wasting anxieties and cares, than it seemed the indication\nof any bodily blight.  It was merely the condensation of the man.\nHe was by no means ill-looking; quite the contrary.\nHis pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and closely wrapped\nup in it, and embalmed with inner health and strength,\nlike a revivified Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared\nto endure for long ages to come, and to endure always, as now;\nfor be it Polar snow or torrid sun, like a patent chronometer,\nhis interior vitality was warranted to do well in all climates.\nLooking into his eyes, you seemed to see there the yet lingering\nimages of those thousand-fold perils he had calmly confronted\nthrough life.  A staid, steadfast man, whose life for the most\npart was a telling pantomime of action, and not a tame chapter\nof sounds.  Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude,\nthere were certain qualities in him which at times affected,\nand in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest.\nUncommonly conscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep\nnatural reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his life did\ntherefore strongly incline him to superstition; but to that sort\nof superstition, which in some organizations seems rather\nto spring, somehow, from intelligence than from ignorance.\nOutward portents and inward presentiments were his.\nAnd if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul,\nmuch more did his far-away domestic memories of his young Cape\nwife and child, tend to bend him still more from the original\nruggedness of his nature, and open him still further to those latent\ninfluences which, in some honest-hearted men, restrain the gush\nof dare-devil daring, so often evinced by others in the more\nperilous vicissitudes of the fishery.  \"I will have no man\nin my boat,\" said Starbuck, \"who is not afraid of a whale.\"\nBy this, he seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable\nand useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation\nof the encountered peril, but that an utterly fearless man\nis a far more dangerous comrade than a coward."

For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this critical ocean\nto kill whales for my living, and not to be killed by them for theirs;\nand that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck well knew.\nWhat doom was his own father's?

'Halloa,' says I, 'what's the matter now,\nold fellow?'  'Look ye here,' says he; 'let's argue the insult.\nCaptain Ahab kicked ye, didn't he?'  'Yes, he did,' says I—'right here\nit was.'

In\nthe length he attains, and in his baleen, the Fin-back\nresembles the right whale, but is of a less portly girth,\nand a lighter color, approaching to olive.  His great lips present\na cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting folds\nof large wrinkles.  His grand distinguishing feature, the fin,\nfrom which he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object.\nThis fin is some three or four feet long, growing vertically\nfrom the hinder part of the back, of an angular shape,\nand with a very sharp pointed end.

Literally this\nword means Fat-Cutter; usage, however, in time made it equivalent\nto Chief Harpooneer.  In those days, the captain's authority was\nrestricted to the navigation and general management of the vessel;\nwhile over the whale-hunting department and all its concerns,\nthe Specksynder or Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme.\nIn the British Greenland Fishery, under the corrupted title\nof Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is still retained,\nbut his former dignity is sadly abridged.  At present he ranks simply\nas senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the captain's\nmore inferior subalterns.  Nevertheless, as upon the good conduct\nof the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends,\nand since in the American Fishery he is not only an important\nofficer in the boat, but under certain circumstances (night watches\non a whaling ground) the command of the ship's deck is also his;\ntherefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands,\nthat he should nominally live apart from the men before the mast,\nand be in some way distinguished as their professional superior;\nthough always, by them, familiarly regarded as their social equal."

In the fireside narrative of Captain Sleet,\nentitled \"A Voyage among the Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale,\nand incidentally for the re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies\nof Old Greenland;\" in this admirable volume, all standers\nof mast-heads are furnished with a charmingly circumstantial\naccount of the then recently invented crow's-nest of the Glacier,\nwhich was the name of Captain Sleet's good craft.\nHe called it the Sleet's crow's-nest, in honor of himself;\nhe being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all\nridiculous false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own\nchildren after our own names (we fathers being the original\ninventors and patentees), so likewise should we denominate\nafter ourselves any other apparatus we may beget.  In shape,\nthe Sleet's crow's-nest is something like a large tierce or pipe;\nit is open above, however, where it is furnished with a movable\nsidescreen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale.\nBeing fixed on the summit of the mast, you ascend into it\nthrough a little trap-hatch in the bottom.  On the after side,\nor side next the stern of the ship, is a comfortable seat,\nwith a locker underneath for umbrellas, comforters, and coats.\nIn front is a leather rack, in which to keep your speaking\ntrumpet, pipe, telescope, and other nautical conveniences.\nWhen Captain Sleet in person stood his mast-head in this\ncrow's-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a rifle with him\n(also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask and shot,\nfor the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or vagrant\nsea unicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot successfully\nshoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water,\nbut to shoot down upon them is a very different thing.\nNow, it was plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe,\nas he does, all the little detailed conveniences of his crow's-nest;\nbut though he so enlarges upon many of these, and though\nhe treats us to a very scientific account of his experiments\nin this crow's-nest, with a small compass he kept there\nfor the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from\nwhat is called the \"local attraction\" of all binnacle magnets;\nan error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in\nthe ship's planks, and in the Glacier's case, perhaps, to there\nhaving been so many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew;\nI say, that though the Captain is very discreet and\nscientific here, yet, for all his learned \"binnacle deviations,\"\n\"azimuth compass observations,\" and \"approximate errors,\"\nhe knows very well, Captain Sleet, that he was not so much\nimmersed in those profound magnetic meditations, as to fail being\nattracted occasionally towards that well replenished little\ncase-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow's nest,\nwithin easy reach of his hand.  Though, upon the whole, I greatly\nadmire and even love the brave, the honest, and learned Captain;\nyet I take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore\nthat case-bottle, seeing what a faithful friend and comforter\nit must have been, while with mittened fingers and hooded head\nhe was studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird's nest\nwithin three or four perches of the pole."

In a pirate,\nman-of-war, or slave ship, when the captain is rowed anywhere\nin his boat, he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable,\nsometimes cushioned seat there, and often steers himself with a pretty\nlittle milliner's tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons.\nBut the whale-boat has no seat astern, no sofa of that sort whatever,\nand no tiller at all.  High times indeed, if whaling captains were wheeled\nabout the water on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs.\nAnd as for a tiller, the whale-boat never admits of any such effeminacy;\nand therefore as in gamming a complete boat's crew must leave the ship,\nand hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number,\nthat subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion, and the captain,\nhaving no place to sit in, is pulled off to his visit all standing\nlike a pine tree.  And often you will notice that being conscious\nof the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from\nthe sides of the two ships, this standing captain is all alive\nto the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs.\nNor is this any very easy matter; for in his rear is the immense\nprojecting steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of\nhis back, the after-oar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front.\nHe is thus completely wedged before and behind, and can only\nexpand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs;\nbut a sudden, violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him,\nbecause length of foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth.\nMerely make a spread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up.\nThen, again, it would never do in plain sight of the world's riveted eyes,\nit would never do, I say, for this straddling captain to be seen\nsteadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything\nwith his hands; indeed, as token of his entire, buoyant self-command,\nhe generally carries his hands in his trowsers' pockets; but perhaps being\ngenerally very large, heavy hands, he carries them there for ballast.\nNevertheless there have occurred instances, well authenticated ones too,\nwhere the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or two,\nin a sudden squall say—to seize hold of the nearest oarsman's hair,\nand hold on there like grim death."

    "innerHtml": "According to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whale-boat\npushes off from the ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as\ntemporary steersman, and the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling\nthe foremost oar, the one known as the harpooneer-oar. Now it needs\na strong, nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish;\nfor often, in what is called a long dart, the heavy implement\nhas to be flung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet.\nBut however prolonged and exhausting the chase, the harpooneer is\nexpected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost; indeed, he is\nexpected to set an example of superhuman activity to the rest, not only\nby incredible rowing, but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations;\nand what it is to keep shouting at the top of one's compass,\nwhile all the other muscles are strained and half started—\nwhat that is none know but those who have tried it.\nFor one, I cannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly\nat one and the same time.  In this straining, bawling state,\nthen, with his back to the fish, all at once the exhausted\nharpooneer hears the exciting cry—\"Stand up, and give it to him!\"\nHe now has to drop and secure his oar, turn round on his centre\nhalf way, seize his harpoon from the crotch, and with what little\nstrength may remain, he essays to pitch it somehow into the whale.\nNo wonder, taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body, that out\nof fifty fair chances for a dart, not five are successful; no wonder\nthat so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated;\nno wonder that some of them actually burst their blood-vessels\nin the boat; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are absent four\nyears with four barrels; no wonder that to many ship owners,\nwhaling is but a losing concern; for it is the harpooneer that makes\nthe voyage, and if you take the breath out of his body how can\nyou expect to find it there when most wanted!"
  },

    "innerHtml": "Again, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical instant,\nthat is, when the whale starts to run, the boatheader and harpooneer\nlikewise start to running fore and aft, to the imminent jeopardy\nof themselves and every one else.  It is then they change places;\nand the headsman, the chief officer of the little craft, takes his\nproper station in the bows of the boat."
  },
  {
    "tag": "p",
    "innerHtml": "Now, I care not who maintains the contrary, but all this\nis both foolish and unnecessary.  The headsman should stay\nin the bows from first to last; he should both dart the harpoon\nand the lance, and no rowing whatever should be expected\nof him, except under circumstances obvious to any fisherman.\nI know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss of speed\nin the chase; but long experience in various whalemen of more\nthan one nation has convinced me that in the vast majority\nof failures in the fishery, it has not by any means been so much\nthe speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion\nof the harpooneer that has caused them."

Thereby the weapon\nis instantly at hand to its hurler, who snatches it up as readily\nfrom its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall.\nIt is customary to have two harpoons reposing in the crotch,\nrespectively called the first and second irons."

It is a doubling of the chances.\nBut it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous, violent,\nconvulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron,\nit becomes impossible for the harpooneer, however lightning-like\nin his movements, to pitch the second iron into him.\nNevertheless, as the second iron is already connected with the line,\nand the line is running, hence that weapon must, at all events,\nbe anticipatingly tossed out of the boat, somehow and somewhere;\nelse the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands.\nTumbled into the water, it accordingly is in such cases;\nthe spare coils of box line (mentioned in a preceding chapter)\nmaking this feat, in most instances, prudently practicable.\nBut this critical act is not always unattended with the saddest\nand most fatal casualties."

But by those clanking links,\nthe vast corpse itself, not the ship, is to be moored.\nTied by the head to the stern, and by the tail to the bows,\nthe whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel's,\nand seen through the darkness of the night, which obscured\nthe spars and rigging aloft, the two—ship and whale,\nseemed yoked together like colossal bullocks, whereof one reclines\nwhile the other remains standing.*"

The strongest and most\nreliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside,\nis by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density that part\nis relatively heavier than any other (excepting the side-fins), its\nflexibility even in death, causes it to sink low beneath the surface;\nso that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat, in order to put\nthe chain round it.  But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome:\na small, strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end,\nand a weight in its middle, while the other end is secured to the ship.\nBy adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other\nside of the mass, so that now having girdled the whale, the chain\nis readily made to follow suit; and being slipped along the body,\nis at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail, at the point\nof junction with its broad flukes or lobes.</em>"

So like a choice casket\nis it secreted in him, that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily\ndeny that the Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable\nsemblance of one formed by the cubic-yards of his sperm magazine.\nLying in strange folds, courses, and convolutions, to their apprehensions,\nit seems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard\nthat mystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence."

But, to this, Bishop Jebb's anticipative answer is ready.\nIt is not necessary, hints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in\nthe whale's belly, but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth.\nAnd this seems reasonable enough in the good Bishop.

Though the word ambergris is but the French\ncompound for grey amber, yet the two substances are quite distinct.\nFor amber, though at times found on the sea-coast, is also dug up in some\nfar inland soils, whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea.\nBesides, amber is a hard, transparent, brittle, odorless substance,\nused for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and ornaments; but ambergris\nis soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and spicy, that it is largely used\nin perfumery, in pastiles, precious candles, hair-powders, and pomatum.\nThe Turks use it in cooking, and also carry it to Mecca, for the same\npurpose that frankincense is carried to St. Peter's in Rome.

As its name imports (smeer, fat;\nberg, to put up), this village was founded in order to afford\na place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried out,\nwithout being taken home to Holland for that purpose.\nIt was a collection of furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds;\nand when the works were in full operation certainly gave forth\nno very pleasant savor.  But all this is quite different\nfrom a South Sea Sperm Whaler; which in a voyage of four\nyears perhaps, after completely filling her hold with oil,\ndoes not, perhaps, consume fifty days in the business of boiling out;\nand in the state that it is casked, the oil is nearly scentless.\nThe truth is, that living or dead, if but decently treated,\nwhales as a species are by no means creatures of ill odor;\nnor can whalemen be recognised, as the people of the middle\nages affected to detect a Jew in the company, by the nose.\nNor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant,\nwhen, as a general thing, he enjoys such high health;\ntaking abundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it is true,\nseldom in the open air.

And, in these cases,\nsomewhat as a pilot, when about losing sight of a coast, whose general\ntrending he well knows, and which he desires shortly to return to again,\nbut at some further point; like as this pilot stands by his compass,\nand takes the precise bearing of the cape at present visible,\nin order the more certainly to hit aright the remote, unseen headland,\neventually to be visited:  so does the fisherman, at his compass,\nwith the whale; for after being chased, and diligently marked,\nthrough several hours of daylight, then, when night obscures\nthe fish, the creature's future wake through the darkness is almost\nas established to the sagacious mind of the hunter, as the pilot's\ncoast is to him.  So that to this hunter's wondrous skill,\nthe proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water, a wake,\nis to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land.\nAnd as the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly\nknown in its every pace, that, with watches in their hands, men time\nhis rate as doctors that of a baby's pulse; and lightly say of it,\nthe up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot,\nat such or such an hour; even so, almost, there are occasions\nwhen these Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep,\naccording to the observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves,\nso many hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles,\nwill have about reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude.\nBut to render this acuteness at all successful in the end, the wind\nand the sea must be the whaleman's allies; for of what present avail\nto the becalmed or wind-bound mariner is the skill that assures him\nhe is exactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter from his port?\nInferable from these statements, are many collateral subtile matters\ntouching the chase of whales."
