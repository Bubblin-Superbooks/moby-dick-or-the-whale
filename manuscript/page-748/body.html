is instantly at hand to its hurler, who snatches it up as readily
from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall.
It is customary to have two harpoons reposing in the crotch,
respectively called the first and second irons.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">But these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected
with the line; the object being this:  to dart them both,
if possible, one instantly after the other into the same whale;
so that if, in the coming drag, one should draw out, the other
may still retain a hold.  It is a doubling of the chances.
But it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous, violent,
convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron,
it becomes impossible for the harpooneer, however lightning-like
in his movements, to pitch the second iron into him.
Nevertheless, as the second iron is already connected with the line,
and the line is running, hence that weapon must, at all events,
be anticipatingly tossed out</p></div> </div>
