<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Starbuck?  I feel deadly faint, bowed, and humped,
as though I were Adam, staggering beneath the piled centuries
since Paradise.  God!  God!  God!—crack my heart!—stave my brain!—
mockery! mockery! bitter, biting mockery of grey hairs, have I lived
enough joy to wear ye; and seem and feel thus intolerably old?
Close! stand close to me, Starbuck; let me look into a human eye;
it is better than to gaze into sea or sky; better than to gaze
upon God.  By the green land; by the bright hearthstone! this
is the magic glass, man; I see my wife and my child in thine eye.
No, no; stay on board, on board!—lower not when I do; when branded
Ahab gives chase to Moby Dick.  That hazard shall not be thine.
No, no! not with the far away home I see in that eye!"</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"Oh, my Captain! my Captain! noble soul! grand old heart,
after all! why should any one give chase to that hated fish!
Away with me! let us fly these deadly waters!</p></div> </div>
