and stumble in darkness to his pallet, this is his usual lot.
But the whaleman, as he seeks the food of light, so he lives in light.
He makes his berth an Aladdin's lamp, and lays him down in it;
so that in the pitchiest night the ship's black hull still
houses an illumination.</p><p>See with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful
of lamps—often but old bottles and vials, though—to the
copper cooler at the tryworks, and replenishes them there,
as mugs of ale at a vat.  He burns, too, the purest of oil,
in its unmanufactured, and, therefore, unvitiated state;
a fluid unknown to solar, lunar, or astral contrivances ashore.
It is sweet as early grass butter in April.  He goes and hunts
for his oil, so as to be sure of its freshness and genuineness,
even as the traveller on the prairie hunts up his own
supper of game.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
