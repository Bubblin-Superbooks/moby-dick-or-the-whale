Lamatins and Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins
of Nantucket) are included by many naturalists among the whales.
But as these pig-fish are a noisy, contemptible set,
mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers, and feeding on wet hay,
and especially as they do not spout, I deny their credentials
as whales; and have presented them with their passports to quit
the Kingdom of Cetology.</em></p><p>First:  According to magnitude I divide the whales into three primary BOOKS
(subdivisible into CHAPTERS), and these shall comprehend them all,
both small and large.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
