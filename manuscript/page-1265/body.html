<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>"Oh, trebly hooped and welded hip of power!  Oh, high aspiring,
rainbowed jet!â€”that one strivest, this one jettest all in vain!
In vain, oh whale, dost thou seek intercedings with yon
all-quickening sun, that only calls forth life, but gives it not again.
Yet dost thou darker half, rock me with a prouder, if a darker faith.
All thy unnamable imminglings float beneath me here; I am buoyed
by breaths of once living things, exhaled as air, but water now.</p><p>"Then hail, for ever hail, O sea, in whose eternal tossings the wild
fowl finds his only rest.  Born of earth, yet suckled by the sea;
though hill and valley mothered me, ye billows are my foster-brothers!"</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
