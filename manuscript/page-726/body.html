twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction.
All the oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions;
so that to the timid eye of the landsman, they seem as Indian jugglers,
with the deadliest snakes sportively festooning their limbs.
Nor can any son of mortal woman, for the first time, seat himself amid
those hempen intricacies, and while straining his utmost at the oar,

and all these horrible contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings;
he cannot be thus circumstanced without a shudder that makes
the very marrow in his bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly.

more merry mirth, better jokes, and brighter repartees, you never
heard over your mahogany, than you will hear</p></div> </div>
