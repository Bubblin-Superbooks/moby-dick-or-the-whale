 —WHARTON THE WHALE KILLER.

   "So be cheery, my lads, let your hearts never fail,
   While the bold harpooneer is striking the whale!"
 —NANTUCKET SONG.

   "Oh, the rare old Whale, mid storm and gale
In his ocean home will be
   A giant in might, where might is right,
And King of the boundless sea."
 —WHALE SONG.</code></pre></div> </div>
