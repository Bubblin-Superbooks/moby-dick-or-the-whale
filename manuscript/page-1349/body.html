The hour is coming when Ahab would not scare thee from him,
yet would not have thee by him.  There is that in thee, poor lad,
which I feel too curing to my malady.  Like cures like;
and for this hunt, my malady becomes my most desired health.
Do thou abide below here, where they shall serve thee,
as if thou wert the captain.  Aye, lad, thou shalt sit here
in my own screwed chair;</p></div> </div>
