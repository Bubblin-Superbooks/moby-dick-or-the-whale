When the porter is sleepy, the anvil-headed whale would be best.
But these knocking whales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays.
On the spires of some old-fashioned churches you will see sheet-iron
whales placed there for weathercocks; but they are so elevated,
and besides that are to all intents and purposes so labelled
with "Hands off!" you cannot examine them closely enough to decide
upon their merit.</p><p>In bony, ribby regions of the earth, where at the base of high broken
cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain,
you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the Leviathan
partly merged in grass, which of a windy day breaks against them
in a surf of green surges.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Then, again, in mountainous countries where the traveller is
continually girdled by amphitheatrical heights; here and there
from some lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses
of the profiles of whales</p></div> </div>
