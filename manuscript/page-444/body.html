<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent stretch-last-line ">like so many ant-hills of powder,
they all stand before me; and I their match.  Oh, hard! that to
fire others, the match itself must needs be wasting!  What I've dared,
I've willed; and what I've willed, I'll do!  They think me mad—
Starbuck does; but I'm demoniac, I am madness maddened!
That wild madness that's only calm to comprehend itself!
The prophecy was that I should be dismembered; and—Aye!  I lost
this leg.  I now prophesy that I will dismember my dismemberer.
Now, then, be the prophet and the fulfiller one.  That's more than ye,
ye great gods, ever were.  I laugh and hoot at ye, ye cricket-players,
ye pugilists, ye deaf Burkes and blinded Bendigoes!  I will not
say as schoolboys do to bullies—Take some one of your own size;
don't pommel me!  No, ye've knocked me down, and I am up again;
but ye have run and hidden.  Come forth from behind your cotton bags!
I have no long gun to reach ye.  Come, Ahab's compliments to ye;
come and see if ye can swerve me. </p></div> </div>
