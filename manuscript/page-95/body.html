and, therefore, was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall.
Whether any of the relatives of the seamen whose names
appeared there were now among the congregation, I knew not;
but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery,
and so plainly did several women present wear the countenance
if not the trappings of some unceasing grief, that I feel sure
that here before me were assembled those, in whose unhealing
hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused
the old wounds to bleed afresh.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Oh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass;
who standing among flowers can sayâ€”here, here lies my beloved;
ye know not the desolation that broods in bosoms like these.
What bitter blanks in those black-bordered marbles which cover
no ashes!  What despair in those immovable inscriptions!
What deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in the lines
that seem to gnaw</p></div> </div>
