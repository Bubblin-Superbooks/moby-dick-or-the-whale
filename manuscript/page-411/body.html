of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is not so,
is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole historian
of Nantucket, stands accountable.  The worthy Obed tells us, that in
the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were regularly launched in
pursuit of the game, the people of that island erected lofty spars along
the seacoast, to which the look-outs ascended by means of nailed cleats,
something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house. A few years ago this same
plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New Zealand, who, upon descrying
the game, gave notice to the ready-manned boats nigh the beach.
But this custom has now become obsolete; turn we then to the one proper
mast-head,</p></div> </div>
