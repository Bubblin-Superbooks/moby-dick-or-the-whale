tumultuous way, and Ahab's also, as he went lurching along the deck.</p><p>"I have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow,
full of its tormented flaming life; and I have seen it wane
at last, down, down, to dumbest dust.  Old man of oceans!
of all this fiery life of thine, what will at length remain
but one little heap of ashes!"</p><p>"Aye," cried Stubb, "but sea-coal ashes—mind ye that, Mr. Starbuck—
sea-coal, not your common charcoal.  Well, well!  I heard
Ahab mutter, 'Here some one thrusts these cards into these old
hands of mine; swears that I must play them, and no others.'
And damn me, Ahab, but thou actest right; live in the game,
and die in it!"</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
