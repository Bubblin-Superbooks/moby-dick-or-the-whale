with a party of whaling captains, on board a Nantucket ship in the
harbor of Oahu, Sandwich Islands.  Conversation turning upon whales,

strength ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present.
He peremptorily denied for example, that any whale could
so smite his stout sloop-of-war as to cause her to leak so much

Some weeks later, the Commodore set sail in this impregnable craft
for Valparaiso.  But he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale,
that begged a few moments' confidential business with him.
That business consisted in fetching the Commodore's craft such a thwack,
that with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest
port to heave down and repair.  I am not superstitious, but I
consider the Commodore's interview with that whale as providential.
