But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get
fixed in that hole?  It was inserted there by my particular
friend Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to descend
upon the monster's back for the special purpose referred to.
But in very many cases, circumstances require that the harpooneer
shall remain on the whale till the whole tensing or stripping
operation is concluded.  The whale, be it observed, lies almost
entirely submerged, excepting the immediate parts operated upon.
So down there, some ten feet below the level of the deck, the poor
harpooneer flounders about, half on the whale and half in the water,
as the vast mass revolves like a tread-mill beneath him.

a shirt and socks—in which to my eyes, at least, he appeared to
uncommon advantage; and no one had a better chance to observe him,
