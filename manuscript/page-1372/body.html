forty years ago!—ago!  Forty years of continual whaling! forty
years of privation, and peril, and storm-time! forty years on
the pitiless sea! for forty years has Ahab forsaken the peaceful land,
for forty years to make war on the horrors of the deep!
Aye and yes, Starbuck, out of those forty years I have not
spent three ashore.  When I think of this life I have led;
the desolation of solitude it has been; the masoned, walled-town of
a Captain's exclusiveness, which admits but small entrance to any
sympathy from the green country without—oh, weariness! heaviness!
Guinea-coast slavery of solitary command!—when I think of all this;
only half-suspected, not so keenly known to me before—
and how for forty years I have fed upon dry salted fare—
fit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soul!—when the poorest
landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily hand, and broken
the world's fresh bread to my mouldy</p></div> </div>
