as the human fingers in an artificial covering.  "However recklessly
the whale may sometimes serve us," said humorous Stubb one day,
"he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens."</p><p>For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it,
you must needs conclude that the great Leviathan is that one
creature in the world which must remain unpainted to the last.
True, one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another,
but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness.
So there is no earthly way of finding out precisely what
the whale really looks like.  And the only mode in which you
can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour,
is by going a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you run
no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him.
Wherefore, it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious
in your curiosity touching this Leviathan.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
