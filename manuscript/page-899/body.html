of an undecreasing girth, almost equal to that of the brain.
Under all these circumstances, would it be unreasonable to survey and map
out the whale's spine phrenologically?  For, viewed in this light,
the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is more than
compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his spinal cord.</p><p>But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists,
I would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference
to the Sperm Whale's hump.  This august hump, if I mistake not,
rises over one of the larger vertebrae, and is, therefore, in some sort,
the outer convex mould of it.  From its relative situation then,
I should call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness
in the Sperm Whale.  And that the great monster is indomitable,
you will yet have reason to know.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
