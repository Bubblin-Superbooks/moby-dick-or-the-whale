and skeletons, have within thirty years past, at various intervals,
been found at the base of the Alps, in Lombardy, in France,
in England, in Scotland, and in the States of Louisiana, Mississippi,
and Alabama.  Among the more curious of such remains is part of a skull,
which in the year 1779 was disinterred in the Rue Dauphine in Paris,
a short street opening almost directly upon the palace of the Tuileries;
and bones disinterred in excavating the great docks of Antwerp,
in Napoleon's time.  Cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged
to some utterly unknown Leviathanic species.</p></div> </div>
