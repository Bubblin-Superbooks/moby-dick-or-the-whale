the waiting boat, they were quickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego
was long in coming to, and Queequeg did not look very brisk.</p><p>Now, how had this noble rescue been accomplished?  Why, diving after
the slowly descending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made
side lunges near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there;
then dropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards
and upwards, and so hauled out our poor Tash by the head.
He averred, that upon first thrusting in for him, a leg was presented;
but well knowing that that was not as it ought to be, and might
occasion great trouble;—he had thrust back the leg, and by a
dexterous heave and toss, had wrought a somerset upon the Indian;
so that with the next trial, he came forth in the good old way—
head foremost.  As for the great head itself, that was doing
as well as could be expected.</p></div> </div>
