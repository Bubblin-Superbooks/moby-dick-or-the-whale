 (Supplied by a Sub-Sub-Librarian)</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">It will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm
of a poor devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long
Vaticans and street-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random
allusions to whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever,
sacred or profane.  therefore you must not, in every case at least,
take the higgledy-piggledy whale statements, however authentic,
in these extracts, for veritable gospel cetology.  Far from it.
