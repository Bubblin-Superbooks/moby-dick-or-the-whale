<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent stretch-last-line ">this morning the first of its
throwing open to them, a fairer day could not dawn upon that world.
Here's food for thought, had Ahab time to think; but Ahab never thinks;
he only feels, feels, feels; that's tingling enough for mortal
man! to think's audacity.  God only has that right and privilege.
Thinking is, or ought to be, a coolness and a calmness; and our
poor hearts throb, and our poor brains beat too much for that.
And yet, I've sometimes thought my brain was very calmâ€”
frozen calm, this old skull cracks so, like a glass in which
the contents turned to ice, and shiver it.  And still this hair
is growing now; this moment growing, and heat must breed it;
but no, it's like that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere,
between the earthy clefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava.
How the wild winds blow it; they whip it about me as the torn
shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they cling to.
A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this through prison</p></div> </div>
