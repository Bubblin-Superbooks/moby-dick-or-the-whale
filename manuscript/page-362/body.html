among which at present may be numbered:â€”I., the Grampus; II., the
Black Fish; III., the Narwhale; IV., the Thrasher; V., the Killer.</p><p><em>Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain.
Because, while the whales of this order, though smaller than those
of the former order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness
to them in figure, yet the bookbinder's Quarto volume in its
dimensioned form does not preserve the shape of the Folio volume,
but the Octavo volume does.</em></p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
