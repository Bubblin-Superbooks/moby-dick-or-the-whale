By my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale
in particular, I was much struck with a plate representing

palisades on the banks of the Upper Mississippi.  Like those
mystic rocks, too, the mystic-marked whale remains undecipherable.
This allusion to the Indian rocks reminds me of another thing.
Besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the Sperm Whale
presents, he not seldom displays the back, and more especially his flanks,
effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance, by reason
of numerous rude scratches, altogether of an irregular, random aspect.
I should say that those New England rocks on the seacoast,
which Agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping
contact with vast floating icebergsâ€”I should say, that those rocks
must not a little resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular.
