<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">what they call my shadow here on earth
is my true substance.  Methinks that in looking at things spiritual,
we are too much like oysters observing the sun through
the water, and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air.
Methinks my body is but the lees of my better being.
In fact take my body who will, take it I say, it is not me.
And therefore three cheers for Nantucket; and come a stove
boat and stove body when they will, for stave my soul,
Jove himself cannot.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
