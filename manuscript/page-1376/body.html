and let us away!  See, see! the boy's face from the window!
the boy's hand on the hill!"</p><p>But Ahab's glance was averted; like a blighted fruit tree he shook,
and cast his last, cindered apple to the soil.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"What is it, what nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing is it;
what cozening, hidden lord and master, and cruel, remorseless emperor
commands me; that against all natural lovings and longings,
I so keep pushing, and crowding, and jamming myself on all the time;
recklessly making me ready to do what in my own proper, natural heart,
I durst not so much as dare?  Is Ahab, Ahab?  Is it I, God, or who,
that lifts this arm?  But if the great sun move not of himself;
but is as an errand-boy in heaven; nor one single star can revolve,
but by some invisible power; how then can this one small heart beat;
this one small brain think thoughts;</p></div> </div>
