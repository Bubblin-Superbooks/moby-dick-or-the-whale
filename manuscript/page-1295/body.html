since that time, why not my mind?  Besides, supposing we
are loaded with powder barrels aft and lucifers forward;
how the devil could the lucifers get afire in this drenching
spray here?  Why, my little man, you have pretty red hair,
but you couldn't get afire now.  Shake yourself; you're Aquarius,
or the water-bearer, Flask; might fill pitchers at your
coat collar.  Don't you see, then, that for these extra
risks the Marine Insurance companies have extra guarantees?
Here are hydrants, Flask.  But hark, again, and I'll answer
ye the other thing.  First take your leg off from the crown
of the anchor here, though, so I can pass the rope; now listen.
What's the mighty difference between holding a mast's
lightning-rod in the storm, and standing close by a mast
that hasn't got any lightning-rod at all in a storm?
Don't you see, you timber-head, that no harm can come
to the holder of the rod, unless the mast is first struck?
