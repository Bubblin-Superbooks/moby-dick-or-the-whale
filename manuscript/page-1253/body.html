But the mingled, mingling threads of life are woven by warp
and woof:  calms crossed by storms, a storm for every calm.
There is no steady unretracing progress in this life; we do not
advance through fixed gradations, and at the last one pause:â€”
through infancy's unconscious spell, boyhood's thoughtless
faith, adolescence' doubt (the common doom), then scepticism,

and are infants, boys, and men, and Ifs eternally.
Where lies the final harbor, whence we unmoor no more?
In what rapt ether sails the world, of which the weariest
will never weary?  Where is the foundling's father hidden?

in bearing them:  the secret of our paternity lies in their grave,
and we must there to learn it.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">And that same day, too, gazing far down from his</p></div> </div>
