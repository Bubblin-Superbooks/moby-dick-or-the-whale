<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">pills, and then running out
of harm's way, as laborers do in blasting rocks.</p><p>I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris,
certain hard, round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought
might be sailors' trousers buttons; but it afterwards turned
out that they were nothing, more than pieces of small squid
bones embalmed in that manner.</p><p>Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris
should be found in the heart of such decay; is this nothing?
Bethink thee of that saying of St. Paul in Corinthians,
about corruption and incorruption; how that we are sown in dishonor,
but raised in glory.  And likewise call to mind that saying
of Paracelsus about what it is that maketh the best musk.
Also forget not the strange fact that of all things of ill-savor,
Cologne-water, in its rudimental manufacturing stages,
is the worst.</p></div> </div>
