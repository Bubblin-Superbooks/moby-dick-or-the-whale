<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">your white squalls, they.  White squalls? white whale,
shirr! shirr!  Here have I heard all their chat just now,
and the white whale—shirr! shirr!—but spoken of once! and only
this evening—it makes me jingle all over like my tambourine—
that anaconda of an old man swore 'em in to hunt him!
Oh! thou big white God aloft there somewhere in yon darkness,
have mercy on this small black boy down here; preserve him
from all men that have no bowels to feel fear!</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
