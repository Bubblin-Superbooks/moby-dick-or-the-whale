<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">case you will take
great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually
a diademed king of the sea, whose green crown has been put
together for him in this marvellous manner.  But if this whale
be a king, he is a very sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem.
Look at that hanging lower lip! what a huge sulk and pout is
there! a sulk and pout, by carpenter's measurement, about twenty
feet long and five feet deep; a sulk and pout that will yield
you some 500 gallons of oil and more.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">A great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped.
The fissure is about a foot across.  Probably the mother during
an important interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast,
when earthquakes caused the beach to gape.  Over this lip,
as over a slippery threshold, we now slide into the mouth.
Upon my word were I at Mackinaw, I should take this to be the inside
of an Indian wigwam.  Good Lord! is</p></div> </div>
