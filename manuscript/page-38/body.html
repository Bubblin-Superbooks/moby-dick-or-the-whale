and the harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather
than wander further about a strange town on so bitter a night,
I would put up with the half of any decent man's blanket.</p><p>"I thought so.  All right; take a seat.  Supper?—you want supper?
Supper'll be ready directly."</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over</p></div> </div>
