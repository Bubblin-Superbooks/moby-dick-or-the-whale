 I was told of a whale taken near Shetland, that had above a barrel
of herrings in his belly. ...
 One of our harpooneers told me that he caught once a whale in
Spitzbergen that was white all over."

eighty feet in length of the whale-bone kind came in, which (as I
was informed), besides a vast quantity of oil, did afford 500 weight
of baleen. The jaws of it stand for a gate in the garden of
Pitferren."
