and following it back, I emerged from the opening where I entered.
I saw no living thing within; naught was there but bones.</p><p>Cutting me a green measuring-rod, I once more dived within

the great skull echoed—and seizing that lucky chance,
I quickly concluded my own admeasurements.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">These admeasurements I now propose to set before you.

to utter any fancied measurements I please.  Because there are
skeleton authorities you can refer to,</p></div> </div>
