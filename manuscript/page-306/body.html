I instantly gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible;
for my first vague disquietude touching the unknown captain,
now in the seclusion of the sea became almost a perturbation.
This was strangely heightened at times by the ragged Elijah's
diabolical incoherences uninvitedly recurring to me,
with a subtle energy I could not have before conceived of.

which I felt, yet whenever I came to look about me in the ship,
it seemed against all warranty to cherish such emotions.

were a far more barbaric, heathenish, and motley set than any
of the tame merchant-ship</p></div> </div>
