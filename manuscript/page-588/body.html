the sea as the ship at last loomed into view, bearing right down upon
us within a distance of not much more than its length.</p><p>Floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat, as for one
instant it tossed and gaped beneath the ship's bows like a chip
at the base of a cataract; and then the vast hull rolled over it,
and it was seen no more till it came up weltering astern.
Again we swam for it, were dashed against it by the seas,
and were at last taken up and safely landed on board.
Ere the squall came close to, the other boats had cut loose
from their fish and returned to the ship in good time.
The ship had given us up, but was still cruising,
if haply it might light upon some token of our perishing,â€”
an oar or a lance pole.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
