but young vigorous males, or bulls as they are familiarly designated.</p><p>In cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see
a male of full grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm,
evinces his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight
of his ladies.  In truth, this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman,
swimming about over the watery world, surroundingly accompanied by all
the solaces and endearments of the harem.  The contrast between this
Ottoman and his concubines is striking; because, while he is always
of the largest leviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at full growth,
are not more than one-third of the bulk of an average-sized male.
They are comparatively delicate, indeed; I dare say, not to exceed half
a dozen yards round the waist.  Nevertheless, it cannot be denied,
that upon the whole they are hereditarily entitled to en bon point.</p></div> </div>
