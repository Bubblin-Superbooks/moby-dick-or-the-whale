on the sea.  Aye," lighting from the boat to the deck, "thus I
trample on thee, thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high;
thus I split and destroy thee!"</p><p>As the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live

of their commander, the seamen clustered together on the forecastle,
till Ahab, troubledly pacing the deck, shouted out—"To the braces!
Up helm!—square in!"</p><p>In an instant the yards swung round; and as the ship half-wheeled
upon her heel, her three firm-seated graceful masts erectly poised
upon her long, ribbed hull, seemed as the three Horatii pirouetting
on one sufficient steed.</p></div> </div>
