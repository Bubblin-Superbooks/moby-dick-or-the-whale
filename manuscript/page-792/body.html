made by hostile contact with other whales; for I have most remarked
them in the large, full-grown bulls of the species.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin
or blubber of the whale.  It has already been said, that it
is stript from him in long pieces, called blanket-pieces.
Like most sea-terms, this one is very happy and significant.
For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real
blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an Indian poncho slipt
over his head, and skirting his extremity.  It is by reason of this
cosy blanketing of his body, that the whale is enabled to keep
himself comfortable in all weathers, in all seas, times, and tides.
What would become of a Greenland whale, say, in those shuddering,
icy seas of the North, if unsupplied with his cosy surtout?
True, other fish are found exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean</p></div> </div>
