fowls softly feathering the sea, alternate with their fitful flight;
and like to some flag-staff rising from the painted hull of an argosy,

bower in Crete; not Jove, not that great majesty Supreme! did
surpass the glorified White Whale as he so divinely swam.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">On each soft side—coincident with the parted</p></div> </div>
