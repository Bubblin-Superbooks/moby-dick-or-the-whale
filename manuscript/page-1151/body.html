Yet, as the ever-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed
around him, the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver; himself all woven
over with the vines; every month assuming greener, fresher verdure;
but himself a skeleton.  Life folded Death; Death trellised Life;
the grim god wived with youthful Life, and begat him curly-headed glories.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Now, when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale,
and saw the skull an altar, and the artificial smoke ascending
from where the real jet had issued, I marvelled that the king
should regard a chapel as an object of vertu.  He laughed.
But more I marvelled that the priests should swear that smoky jet
of his was genuine.  To and fro I paced before this skeleton—
brushed the vines aside—broke through the ribs—and with a ball
of Arsacidean twine, wandered, eddied long amid its many winding,
shaded colonnades and arbors. </p></div> </div>
