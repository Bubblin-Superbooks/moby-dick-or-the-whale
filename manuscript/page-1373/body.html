from that young girl-wife I wedded past fifty, and sailed for
Cape Horn the next day, leaving but one dent in my marriage pillow—
wife? wife?—rather a widow with her husband alive?  Aye, I widowed
that poor girl when I married her, Starbuck; and then,
the madness, the frenzy, the boiling blood and the smoking brow,
with which, for a thousand lowerings old Ahab has furiously,
foamingly chased his prey—more a demon than a man!—aye, aye! what
a forty years' fool—fool—old fool, has old Ahab been!
Why this strife of the chase? why weary, and palsy the arm
at the oar, and the iron, and the lance? how the richer
or better is Ahab now?  Behold.  Oh, Starbuck! is it not hard,
that with this weary load I bear, one poor leg should have been
snatched from under me?  Here, brush this old hair aside;
it blinds me, that I seem to weep.  Locks so grey did never grow
but from out some ashes!  But do I look very old, so very,
very old,</p></div> </div>
