In a ship I belonged to, a small cub Sperm Whale was once
bodily hoisted to the deck for his poke or bag, to make sheaths
for the barbs of the harpoons, and for the heads of the lances.
Think you I let that chance go, without using my boat-hatchet
and jack-knife, and breaking the seal and reading all the contents
of that young cub?</p><p>And as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan
in their gigantic, full grown development, for that rare knowledge
I am indebted to my late royal friend Tranquo, king of Tranque,
one of the Arsacides.  For being at Tranque, years ago,
when attached to the trading-ship Dey of Algiers, I was invited
to spend part of the Arsacidean holidays with the lord of Tranque,
at his retired palm villa at Pupella; a sea-side glen not very far
distant from what our sailors called Bamboo-Town, his capital.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Among many other fine qualities, my royal friend</p></div> </div>
