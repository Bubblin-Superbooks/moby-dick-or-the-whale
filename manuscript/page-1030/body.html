<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>In his treatise on "Queen-Gold," or Queen-pin-money, an old
King's Bench author, one William Prynne, thus discourseth:
"Ye tail is ye Queen's, that ye Queen's wardrobe may be supplied
with ye whalebone."  Now this was written at a time when the black
limber bone of the Greenland or Right whale was largely used
in ladies' bodices.  But this same bone is not in the tail;
it is in the head, which is a sad mistake for a sagacious lawyer
like Prynne.  But is the Queen a mermaid, to be presented with a tail?
An allegorical meaning may lurk here.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">There are two royal fish so styled by the English law writersâ€”
the whale and the sturgeon; both royal property under certain limitations,
and nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown's ordinary revenue.
I know not that any other author has hinted of the matter;
but by inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided
in the same way as the whale,</p></div> </div>
