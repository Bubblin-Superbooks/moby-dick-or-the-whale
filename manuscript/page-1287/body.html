No fearless fool now fronts thee.  I own thy speechless,
placeless power; but to the last gasp of my earthquake life
will dispute its unconditional, unintegral mastery in me.
In the midst of the personified impersonal, a personality stands here.
Though but a point at best; whenceso'er I came; whereso'er I go;
yet while I earthly live, the queenly personality lives in me,
and feels her royal rights.  But war is pain, and hate is woe.
Come in thy lowest form of love, and I will kneel and kiss thee;
but at thy highest, come as mere supernal power; and though
thou launchest navies of full-freighted worlds, there's that in
here that still remains indifferent.  Oh, thou clear spirit,
of thy fire thou madest me, and like a true child of fire,
I breathe it back to thee."</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">[Sudden, repeated flashes of lightning; the nine flames leap lengthwise
