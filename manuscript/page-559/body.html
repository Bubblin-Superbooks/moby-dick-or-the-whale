this savage's sword, thought I, which thus finally shapes and fashions
both warp and woof; this easy, indifferent sword must be chance—
aye, chance, free will, and necessity—no wise incompatible—
all interweavingly working together.  The straight warp
of necessity, not to be swerved from its ultimate course—
its every alternating vibration, indeed, only tending to that;
free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads;
and chance, though restrained in its play within the right lines
of necessity, and sideways in its motions directed by free will,
though thus prescribed to by both, chance by turns rules either,
and has the last featuring blow at events.</p></div> </div>
