arrange it easily."</p><p>"Bring it up; there's nothing else for it," said Starbuck,
after a melancholy pause.  "Rig it, carpenter; do not look at me soâ€”

with a caulking-iron.</p><p>"Aye."</p><p>"And shall I then pay over the same with pitch, sir?" moving his hand
as with a pitch-pot.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Away!  What possesses thee to this?  Make a life-buoy</p></div> </div>
