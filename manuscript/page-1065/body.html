ringed horizon began to expand around him miserably.
By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him;
but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot;
such, at least, they said he was.  The sea had jeeringly kept
his finite body up, but drowned the infinite of his soul.
Not drowned entirely, though.  Rather carried down alive
to wondrous depths, where strange shapes of the unwarped
primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes;
and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his hoarded heaps;
and among the joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile eternities,
Pip saw the multitudinous, God-omnipresent, coral insects,
that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs.
He saw God's foot upon the treadle of the loom, and spoke it;
and therefore his shipmates called him mad.  So man's insanity
is heaven's sense; and wandering from all mortal reason,
man comes at last to that</p></div> </div>
