<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">single hail, they stood
far parted in the starlight; Ahab in his scuttle, the Parsee
by the main-mast; but still fixedly gazing upon each other;
as if in the Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow, in Ahab
the Parsee his abandoned substance.</p><p>And yet, somehow, did Ahab—in his own proper self, as daily, hourly,
and every instant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates,—
Ahab seemed an independent lord; the Parsee but his slave.
Still again both seemed yoked together, and an unseen
tyrant driving them; the lean shade siding the solid rib.
For be this Parsee what he may, all rib and keel was solid Ahab.</p><p>At the first faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice was
heard from aft,—"Man the mast-heads!"—and all through the day,
till after sunset and after twilight, the same voice every hour,
at the striking of the helmsman's bell, was heard—"What d'ye see?—
sharp! sharp! sharp!"</p></div> </div>
