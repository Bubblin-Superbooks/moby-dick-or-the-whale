as he sits at the head of the table; this is marvellous,
sometimes most comical.  Wherefore this difference?  A problem?
Perhaps not.  To have been Belshazzar, King of Babylon;
and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but courteously,
therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur.
But he who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides
over his own private dinner-table of invited guests, that man's
unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for the time;
that man's royalty of state transcends Belshazzar's, for Belshazzar
was not the greatest.  Who has but once dined his friends, has tasted
what it is to be Caesar.  It is a witchery of social czarship
which there is no withstanding.  Now, if to this consideration
you super-add the official supremacy of a ship-master, then,
by inference, you will derive the cause of that peculiarity
of sea-life just mentioned.</p></div> </div>
