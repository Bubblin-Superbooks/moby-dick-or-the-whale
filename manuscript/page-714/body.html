stagnant calm; when the long burnished sun-glade on the waters
seemed a golden finger laid across them, enjoining some secrecy;
when the slippered waves whispered together as they softly ran on;

cry that startled every man from his nod, the negro yelled
out—"There! there again! there she breaches! right ahead!
