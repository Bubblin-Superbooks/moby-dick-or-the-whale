and every rod that it so floats, what seem square roods of sharks
and cubic roods of fowls, augment the murderous din.  For hours
and hours from the almost stationary ship that hideous sight is seen.
Beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky, upon the fair face
of the pleasant sea, wafted by the joyous breezes, that great mass
of death floats on and on, till lost in infinite perspectives.</p><p>There's a most doleful and most mocking funeral!
The sea-vultures all in pious mourning, the air-sharks all
punctiliously in black or speckled.  In life but few of them would
have helped the whale, I ween, if peradventure he had needed it;
but upon the banquet of his funeral they most piously do pounce.
Oh, horrible vulturism of earth! from which not the mightiest
whale is free.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Nor is this the end.  Desecrated as the body is, a vengeful
ghost survives and hovers over it to scare. </p></div> </div>
